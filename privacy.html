    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-12-28</p>

    <p>
      Paris Street Bikes is a personal project. This policy explains how we handle data when generating and uploading
      cycling videos.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect personal data from the public. The service is intended for the account owner’s use.
    </p>

    <h2>2. OAuth Tokens & Platform Data</h2>
    <p>
      When you connect a platform account (e.g., TikTok), the platform may provide access tokens and limited account
      information required to upload videos. We use this data only to perform the requested uploads.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Storage</h2>
    <p>
      If tokens are stored, they are stored securely for the sole purpose of keeping the connection active.
      You can revoke access at any time from your platform settings.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or share personal data with third parties. Content is uploaded only to the platform(s) you authorize.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect tokens and any operational logs. However, no system is 100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy by posting a new version on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      Contact: <a href="mailto:contact.alphaquantsearch@gmail.com">contact.alphaquantsearch@gmail.com</a>
